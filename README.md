Technology today permeates every aspect of our lives, enhancing daily activities and saving time. In line with this goal, this software seeks to streamline the ordering process in the canteen, which often consumes a significant portion of the break time available to university students and staff. One potential solution to this challenge is the automation of the canteen.

The canteen automation will be implemented through a web application tailored to meet the specific requirements of Epoka Canteen, while simultaneously simplifying management tasks during peak hours.

This system will offer users (students and staff) the convenience of placing online orders in real-time, thereby minimizing lengthy queues. With real-time communication between cashiers and clients, transactions will be expedited and optimized. Additionally, canteen staff will experience a more organized workflow and enhanced management in processing and delivering orders, as well as in managing internal operations.

This application will serve as an extension of the existing Epoka University Web Application, ensuring that student accounts are more secure and user-friendly.
